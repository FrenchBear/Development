Using ZAP.EXE to Find Duplicate DLLs and VBXs            [B_VBasic]


Visual Basic support engineers regularly encounter problems caused by users
with more than one copy of a particular DLL or VBX. The ZAP.EXE utility
makes what used to be a tedious and time-consuming problem a great deal
easier and quicker to solve. The main features of ZAP.EXE are as follows:

 - It can search any combination of the MS-DOS search path, the Windows
   search path (that is, \WINDOWS and \WINDOWS\SYSTEM), and a recursive
   search path through the hard disk starting at any directory.

 - It can find DLLs, VBXs, and/or any other file specification.

 - The size, date and time of creation, and (where possible) version number
   of each file is returned, making analysis simple.

 - You can delete files from within the ZAP.EXE utility by selecting the
   file in the list box display and pressing the DELETE key or by dragging
   and dropping the file from the list box into the trash can icon.

 - You can copy or move files by dragging and dropping the file into the
   diskette icon and then selecting a destination for the file.

The included source code is fully commented. The special features of the
code are as follows:

 - Tabbed list box and tabbed text box that use a font other than the
   system font

 - List box with bound horizontal scroll bar

 - Data structure designed to make sorting of data much quicker

 - Drag-and-drop feature

 - Feature that checks to see whether a DLL or VBX is in use before
   deleting it.

 - Increased-speed method of getting a directory listing

 - Use of the Windows API to get file version numbers
