Title: API Form
Description: This demonstrates how to create a form using API only. It also creates a edit control (textbox) and a button control (command button). It subclasses the form and the command button and when the command button is clicked a message box pops up. Code is heavily commented and explains to you EXACTLY what the code does. If you have difficulty understanding the code, then don't hesitate to e-mail me. I'll be glad to help.
