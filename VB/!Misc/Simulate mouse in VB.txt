2- Then you call your functions and subs
2.1- To move the cusor:
   SetCursorPos(X,Y) ' Where X and Y are in pixel
2.2- To get cursor location
   Dim tempPos As Point
   Dim R As Long = GetCursorPos(tempPos) ' You'll get your location in TempPos
2.3- To semulate clicks
2.3.1 Left click
   mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN, 0, 0, 0, 0)
   mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP, 0, 0, 0, 0)
2.3.2 Right click
   mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTDOWN, 0, 0, 0, 0)
   mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTUP, 0, 0, 0, 0)
2.3.3 Middle Click
   mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_MIDDLEDOWN, 0, 0, 0, 0)
   mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_MIDDLEUP, 0, 0, 0, 0)

2.4- To semulate drag and drop:
   mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN, 0, 0, 0, 0)
   SetCursorPos(X,Y) ' Where X and Y are in pixel
   mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP, 0, 0, 0, 0)
