            MenuEv   MenuEv provides menu selection notification.  In
                     other words, it tells you when the user has

                     MenuEv is really easy to use.  All you need to do 
                     is place it on your form.  There's nothing to set.
                     Events start coming in automatically.  The events
                     give you the text of the menu item selected.

            Probe    This VBX lets you examine and modify other 
                     controls' properties at run-time.  After telling 
                     Probe the name of another control, Probe will give 
                     you a list of the properties in that control.  

                     Probe can also display a dialog box that will let 
                     you modify other controls' properties (at run-time).  
                     Probe's dialog box makes it possible to fiddle with 
                     the properties of other controls at run-time.  
                     Common dialog boxes are used for fonts and colors to 
                     make selection easier.

            SoundX   This control provides Soundex and Metaphone
                     algorithms.  Soundex and Metaphone convert words
                     or names to codes that represent how they "sound".
                     This can be really useful in a database
                     application where users need to find names they
                     may not know how to spell exactly.
                     
                     Use this control to make it easier for them.  
                     Just put the word or name you want converted in, 
                     and the appropriate codes come out.

                     information from a file (EXE, DLL, VBX, etc.) 
                     very easy.  Ver also gives you file installation 
                     functionality.  Included with the control is a 
                     sample installation/setup utility.  This makes 
                     it easier for you to write your own installation 
                     utilities without the bulk of the Setup Wizard.
