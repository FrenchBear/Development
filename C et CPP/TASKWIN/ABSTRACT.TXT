 TASKWIND: Maps Instance Handles to Task Handles
 
 TASKWIND implements a method for mapping instance handles
 to window handles and describes several ways to extract
 information from the task database structure.
 
 TASKWIND uses GetWindow to walk and display the list of
 top-level windows, much like the Task Manager that comes
 with Microsoft(R) Windows(TM). Unlike Task Manager,
 TASKWIND also displays a list of all the tasks that are
 currently running. Button selections allow the user to
 retrieve information pertinent to a certain task, and also
 to perform operations similar to those offered by Task
 Manager.
 
 TASKWIND is a companion application for "What's the
 Difference Between Windows and Tasks in Windows 3.1" by
 Matt Pietrek (Microsoft Systems Journal, Vol. 8, No. 10).
 The source code for this application has not been modified
 or tested for the Microsoft Developer Network CD. The
 source files may appear in various forms (source code
 only, ready to build, or ready to run).
