The version of the code with this makefile is Version 2.0.2.
No CHANGES file is included here; for a history of previous versions see
	http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijbdist.html#previous
This version tightens security over 2.0.1; some multi-user sites will need
to change the listen-address in the configuration file (see previous URL).

For installation on Windows see http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijbwin.html
An executable is provided so you don't need nmake or a C compiler.

For UNIX and other systems see the FAQ. If you just want to test it with its
defaults of simply stopping cookies and private info, all you need to do now
on most Unix systems is type make, run junkbuster & and configure your browser.
