  This program executable and all source code is released into the public
  domain.  You may use this code for any purpose but please give me a little
  credit for any use of this code.  The primary purpose of this application 
  was to learn what it takes to write a Windows Sockets Application.

  My development and testing was all completed at home on two 386 PC's using
  the Trumpet Windows Sockets DLL Alpha 15 with NCSA Telnet and WinQVT/Net 2.6
  and 3.9 as the remote host.  Source code may be compiled with Borland C++
  in large mode.

  Some code concepts and names are based on code that is copyright by the
  Regents of the University of California or code published in UNIX Network
  Programming by W. Richard Stevens or code in WATTCP or other public sources.
  The rest is based on my knowledge of Windows programming and my 
  interpretation of RFC 969 and the Windows Sockets API version 1.1.

  This code implements both a blocking and a non-blocking (async) ping.

  You can specify a hostname (or ip address) on the command line.  In that
  case an Async Ping is performed.

  Known problems:

  1) Most Windows Sockets DLL's do not support the use of RAW_SOCKETS
     so this application will not work with many implementations.  The
     only one that I am aware of is Trumpet Windows Sockets DLL Alpha 15.

  2) "Network subsystem failure" probably means that the ARP request for
     a local host or default gateway failed.
