ACE:	Access Control Entry
ACL:	Access Control List. A list of security protections that applies to an object. (An object can be a file, process, event, or anything else having a security descriptor.) An entry in an access control list (ACL) is an access control entry (ACE). There are two types of access control list, discretionary and system. 
DACL:	Discretionary Access Control List. An access control list that is controlled by the owner of an object and that specifies the access particular users or groups can have to the object. 
SACL:	System Access Control List. An ACL that controls the generation of audit messages for attempts to access a securable object. The ability to get or set an object's SACL is controlled by a privilege typically held only by system administrators. 
SDDL:	Security Descriptor Definition Language. 
SID:	security identifier. A data structure of variable length that identifies user, group, and computer accounts. Every account on a network is issued a unique SID when the account is first created. Internal processes in Windows refer to an account's SID rather than the account's user or group name.
