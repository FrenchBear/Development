Download C# and Visual Basic

Want to start developing in C# and Visual Basic? Download Visual Studio 2015, which has the latest features built-in. There are also prebuilt Azure VM images available with VS 2015 already installed.

To install the latest release without Visual Studio, run one of the following nuget command lines:

nuget install Microsoft.Net.Compilers   # Install C# and VB compilers
nuget install Microsoft.CodeAnalysis    # Install Language APIs and Services

To get the latest "preview" drop, published about once per month, add the -pre switch to the nuget commands.
