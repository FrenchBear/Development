I'd like to write an HTML+CSS+javascript file to implement an interactive viewer of a complex function.

The user interface should contain two parts:
- a form area containing input elements such as text and range inputs where the parameters of the drawing are entered. Upon modification, the function should be redrawn.
- a canvas area where the function is drawn

The drawing area represent a part of the complex plan, real axis (x axis) between x_plan_min and x_plan_max, imaginary axis (y axis) between y_plan_min and y_plan_max. A checkbox should be used to decide whether a light gray grid should be drawn for integer values on real and imaginary axes, the line for x=0 and y=0 being a bit darker or thicker.
Note that the scale should be identical on x and y axes, and the graph centered in the canvas area, so either x range or y range may be expandad as needed for drawing depending on the actual size of the carvas on the browser screen.

Several complex functions (from C to C) should be implemented in javascript in a separate file, such as f1(z)=z^1.5 or f2(z)=1/z and a drop down or a list selector should be used the form area to chose which function to draw. Two numerical real values a and b can be entered in the interface and used by the calculation of the function, for example, f3(z)=z^(a+b*i)

To represent the complex function, draw a square grid of lines, vertical lines with x constant and y between y_grid_min and y_grid_max using a step of y_grid_step, and horizontal lines with y constant between x_grid_min and x_grid_max using a step of x_grid_step, and then draw the transformation of this grid using selected function.

A gradient of colors should be used when drawing the grid, before and after transformation through the function, using 4 colors (ex: red, blue, green, dark yellow), one for each corner of the grid, intermediate points using an interpolated color between each corner.

The forms area should contain should contain several areas (fieldset elements) to enter values:
- an area to enter the part of represented complex plan: x_plan_min, x_plan_max, y_plan_min, y_plan_max, and a checkbox to draw axes.
- an area to enter the parameters of the grid: x_grid_min, x_grid_max, x_grid_step and y_grid_min, y_grid_max, y_grid_step
- an area to select the predefined function, plus the two numerical parameters a and b that can be used by the function
